Technology stack used:

React-hooks
material -ui

Approach:

Went with creating the the basic event view first and built the following code upon it. App.js is being served as container component. Didnt get enough time to refactor more. Added different directory structure for the code based on the functionality. Didn't get enough time to use redux-thunk approach. Went with my first try of material ui as the team is using material UI. wanted to give it a shot.


Local run:

install - yarn
build - yarn build
start - yarn start
